                    <p>The badminton court is rectangular and it is divided by a net into two equal rectangles. The standard setting for a court is to be marked for both singles and doubles matches. The doubles court is wider than the singles one, but both are the same length</p>

                    <p>The history of badminton is not fully clear and some parts of it remain a mystery. Badminton appears to be an evolution of a game called battledore and shuttlecock, which origins go way back in time. Badminton, as we know it today, was, according to most sources, invented and developed by the British in the middle of the 19th century.</p>

                    <p>The second mandatory item is the shuttle. This is what distinguishes badminton from all the other racket sports and what makes it so unique. The shuttles used in competitions are called feathered shuttles and they are not cheap to buy, especially because they do not last that long.</p>

                    <li>
                        Basic Strokes
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grip: Learn the basic grips: forehand and backhand. Ensure you are holding the racket correctly to maximize control and power.</li>
                            <li>Serve: Start with the basic low serve to keep the shuttle low over the net. Progress to high serves and flick serves as you get more comfortable.</li>
                            <li>Clear: Use an underhand clear to hit the shuttle high and deep into the opponent's court.</li>
                            <li>Drop Shot: Practice drop shots to make your opponent move quickly to the front of the court.</li>
                            <li>Smash: Learn the basic smash technique for a powerful downward shot.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Footwork
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic Footwork: Practice moving quickly and efficiently around the court. Work on side steps, front-back movements, and diagonal movements.</li>
                            <li>Split Step: Use the split step to prepare for your opponent's shot. This involves a small jump to stay light on your feet and ready to move in any direction.</li>
                            <li>Ready Stance: Always maintain a ready stance with knees slightly bent and racket up. This will help you react quickly to shots.</li>
                            <li>Base Position: Return to the center of the court (base position) after each shot to prepare for the next one.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        Strategy

                            <li>Shot Placement: Focus on placing your shots accurately rather than just hitting hard. Aim for the corners and lines to make your opponent move.</li>
                            <li>Deception: Use body language and racket movements to deceive your opponent, making them anticipate a different shot.</li>
                            <li>Consistent Play: Aim for consistency rather than trying for difficult shots. Keep the shuttle in play and wait for your opponent to make mistakes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>Endurance: Work on your stamina and cardiovascular fitness to maintain a high level of play throughout the match.</li>
